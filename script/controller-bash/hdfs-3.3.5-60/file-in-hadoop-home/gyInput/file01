When her shift was over, she changed in the little closet of an employee
bathroom, rolling her work uniform and apron into a tight cylinder before
tucking it in her knapsack, so they would not wrinkle. She did not own an iron
and this way, if she was careful, she could wear the same uniform for a week
or more before she had to brave the Laundromat. Then, in jeans and a T-shirt,
she headed to class.
