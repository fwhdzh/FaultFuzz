Three evenings a week, Mia boarded the 1 and rode to 116th Street, where
she put on a different uniform and waited tables at a bar near Columbia. The
undergrads she served tended to be either haughty and obnoxious or leering
and obnoxious, more so as the night wore on, but they tipped her, and at the
end of a good night she might have thirty or forty dollars in her apron. She ate
the last bites of their burgers and their forgotten fries and the stubs of their
pickles for dinner and folded all the cash into her jeans pocket.
